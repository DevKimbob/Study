# Streams
* Byte stream : Byte
  * binary file, ...
  * 
    ```java
    InputStream
    OutputStream
    ```
* Char stream : Charactor(2 Bytes)
  * just text
  * 
    ```java
    Reader
    Writer
    ```

## Stream Connection
```java
InputStreamReader rd = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
int c = rd.read();
```
> System.in is apparently Byte Input Stream

# Charactor Stream and File IO
Charactor Stream : 2 Byte Unicode
```java
FileReader fin = new FileReader("C:\\test.txt");
int c = fin.read();

char[] buf = new char[1024];
int n = fin.read(buf);
```
> why fin.read() returns int not byte(or char even)
>
> byte's size is 2Bytes(0x00 ~ 0xFF). if fin were to read "-1" as byte, return would be 0xFF. but it has no diff from EOF(0xFF).
> 
> by having return ty
> 
> pe as int, we can diff those two by having "-1" as 0x000000FF, and EOF as 0xFFFFFFFF

## ?Making Streams
The difference between using FileInputStream combined with InputStreamReader and using FileReader in Java mainly lies in their purpose and the way they handle character encoding.

FileReader
```java
FileReader fileReader = new FileReader("example.txt");
BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(fileReader);
String line;
while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
    System.out.println(line);
}
bufferedReader.close();
```

FileInputStream -> InputStreamReader
```java
FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("example.txt");
InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(fileInputStream, "UTF-8");
BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(inputStreamReader);
String line;
while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
    System.out.println(line);
}
bufferedReader.close();
```

# Byte Stream and File IO

# Buffer IO and File IO
```java
BufferedInputStream(InputStream in);
BufferedReader(Reader in);
```

# File Class
files and directories
```java
boolean mkdir()
String[] list()
String getPath()
boolean isFile()
...
```

# File copy
1. Text File Copy
    ```java
    FileReader.read() -> FileWriter.write()
    ```
2. Binary File Copy
    ```java
    FileInputStream.read() -> FileOutputStream.write()
    ```
3. Fast Block File Copy
    ```java
    FileInputStream.read(buf) -> FileOutputStream.write(buf, 0, n)
    ```

Speed when copying the same file : `FastBlock > Text > Binary`
