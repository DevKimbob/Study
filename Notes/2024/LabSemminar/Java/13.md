# Multi-tasking
multi-processing vs multi-threading

# Java's Multi-threading
* java thread is handled by JVM
* single JVM runs a single Java application
  * a Java application can run multiple threads
> if you were to run two "Java applications" you need two JVMs

each thread is bonded with TCB(Thread Control Block)

# Creating Threads
## A. Using java.lang.Thread class
```java
class TimerThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        ...
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TimerThread th = new TimerThread();
        th.start();
    }
}
```

## B. Using java.lang.Runnable interface
```java
class TimerRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        ...
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread th = new Thread(new TimerRunnable());
        th.start();
    }
}
```

## Diff
basically class vs interface ish. java cannot have multi-class inheritance. 

# Thread life cycle
NEW, RUNNABLE, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, BLOCK, TERMINATED
* NEW : new born
* RUNNABLE : ether "runnable" or "running"
* WAITING : `Object.wait()` is called. call `Object.notify()` or `Object.notifyAll()` to continue.
* TIMED_WAITING : called `sleep()`. when time out go to RUNNABLE
* BLOCK : blocked by io job. other threads are scheduled
* TERMINATED : terminated
> NEW -> RUNNABLE : start()
> RUNNABLE <-> RUNNABLE : (run() or JVM scheduled) and yield()

## Thread priority
* MAX_PRIORITY : 10
* MIN_PRIORITY : 1
* NORMAL_PRIORITY(default) : 5
```java
void setPriority(int priority)
int getPriority()
```

# Important thing with yield
Java thread uses nonpreemptive scheduling. there for it cannot pass its runnable-ish thing to other threads, so you have to call yield on some cases. but, when running JVM on multi-threading capable OSs, like windows, JVM maps OS's threads to Java threads, making them preemptive scheduling possible. there for you dont need to call yield.

# Killing a Thread
thread terminates when `run()` method finishes
```java
public void run() {
    ...
    return;
}
```

or you can use `interrupt()`
```java
public void run() {
    try { ... }
    catch (InterruptedException e) {
        return;
    }
}

th.interrupt();
```

or you can use other ways. for example flags
```java
private boolean flag = false;
public void finish() { flag = true; }
public void run() {
    if (flag == true)
        return;
}

th.start();
th.finish();
```

# Thread Synchronization
using synchronized keyword
```java
synchronized void add() {
    int n = getCurrentSum();
    n += 10;
    setCurrentSum(n);
}
```

# wait(), notify(), notifyAll()
all 3 methods must be used inside the `synchrosnized` block
```java
synchronized public void fill() {
    try {
        wait();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        return;
    }
}
```
