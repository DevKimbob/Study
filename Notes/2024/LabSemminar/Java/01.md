# Computer and Programming
Hardware vs Software

## Programming Language
Machine Language, Assembly, High-level Language

## Compile
.java -> .class  
.c/.cpp -> .obj -> .exe

# Java and WORA
Java : Made to be platform independent  
    (and apparently require small memory)

WORA : Write Once Run Anywhere  
possible by
1. byte code
2. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

## Byte Code
javap : class file disassembler. included in JDK  
extracts byte code in class file

## JVM
jvm itself is platform dependent.

# Cpp vs Java
JVMs use java class files kinda like cpp's dynamic library  
Loads class files dynamically(?)
> not sure what's gonna be faster
> (cpp .so vs jvm .class)

# Java Development
## JDK, JRE
JDK(Java Development Kit) vs JRE(Java Runtime Environment)  
JRE is a subset of JDK

### JDK Editions
* Java SE(Standard Edition)
* Java ME(Micro Edition)
* Java EE(Enterprise Edition)
* and more...

## Module Programming
modularity : Started from Java 9  
packages -> module ish

when designing applications using module arch can be a bit confusing

# Java
* Platform indenpendent
* OOP
* encaptulation
* Source(.java) and Class(.class) files
  * 1 source : multiple class
    * only one public class
    * source file name matches public class's name
  * if compiled
    * single class file contains single class
    * so 1 java file -> compiled -> multiplc class files
* Runtime code distribution
  * as jar is possible
* Packages
* Multithreads
* GC
* JIT compiling
